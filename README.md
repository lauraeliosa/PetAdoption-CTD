# CTD-Project Dog Adoption Website

Welcome to my Pet Adoption website project, where I highlight the use of the Dog and Cat API's. 
This project demonstrates how to integrate external APIs into a web application and provides functionality for users to explore different dog breeds and vote on their favorite cat pictures.
